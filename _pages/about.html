			<h6>Our Story</h6>
			<p>It all started back in 2013 with the goal of saving a traditional house. We noticed that too many beautiful old houses in Romania are being destroyed either by neglect or by poor renovation practices, like replacing the original window frames with plastic ones.</p>
			<p>The goal of this project was to do something different - take an old house and bring it into the 21st century while preserving the original character.</p>

			<h6>Our Vision</h6>
			<p><strong>Casa de Cultură</strong> is about allowing everyone to live in a traditional house surrounded by nature, contemporary art, musical instruments and like-minded people. We believe that this setup can unleash the creativity of everyone.</p>
