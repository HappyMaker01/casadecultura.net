			<h6>Our Story</h6>
			<p>It all started back in 2013 with the goal of saving a traditional house. We noticed that too many beautiful old houses in Romania are being destroyed either by neglect or by poor renovation practices, like replacing the original window frames with plastic ones.</p>
			<p>The goal of this project was to do something different - take an old house and bring it into the 21st century (with comfortable kitchen and bathroom) while preserving the original feel of the house.</p>

			<h6>Our Vision</h6>
			<p><strong>Casa de CulturÄƒ</strong> is about allowing everyone to live in a traditional house surrounded by nature, contemporary art, musical instruments and like-minded people. We believe that this setup can unleash the creativity of everyone.</p>

			<h6>The House</h6>
			<p>The house was built in 1930 by the village's blacksmith. It featured 3 rooms and a small kitchen. The toilet was an outhouse. The large barn was used to house cows, donkeys and to store enough hay to feed the livestock over the winter.</p>
			<p>Starting late 2013, the house went through a long restauration process where the barn was converted into a modern living space and the house got modern facilities while preserving its character.</p>
