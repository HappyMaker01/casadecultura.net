        <h1>The House</h1>
        <p>The CasaNoah houses where built in 1890 by the saxons. It featured 5 apartaments and a vintage kitchen with a wood-burning stove, which was also used to cook food for the pigs and as an underground family distillery during the communist regime. As any traditional house in Banat, the house had a pantry, which was always full of homemade sausages, salo, jams, liquors and other goodies. The toilet was an outhouse.</p>
        <p>Starting late 2013, it went through a long restauration process, the idea being to give the house modern facilities while preserving its character.</p>

        <h2>The Small Bedroom</h2>
		<p>A double room with wooden frame windows overlooking the orchard and the yard. You can close the window blinds if you don't want to be woken up by the natural light. The original floor in this room could not be saved, so it has a brand new wooden floor, installed in the same traditional way - with wooden beams and sand underneath, no cement.</p>
